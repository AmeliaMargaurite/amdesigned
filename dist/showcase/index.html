            <p class="description"> Walkers Creek is a camping storage solutions business based on the Sunshine Coast,
              Australia. They were in need of a website to sell their awesome items, and potentially attract
              wholesalers. Working with their needs we built a fast, user-friendly, fully-responsive e-commerce website
              which has seen thousands of site hits and hundreds of sales -- so far!<br /><br />The build included a
              custom built backend for the owners to login and create, edit and update products, as well as keep track
              of processed sales and even send their customers postage confirmation emails.We continue to work with the
              great family behind Walkers Creek to tweak and improve their site and analytics.</p><a class="btn mini"

            <p class="title">Online Booking - Jenny's Hairdressing</p>
            <p class="description"> The fabulous Jenny has been working her magic for years and finally had decided to
              build her own hairdressing empire. She had everything ready to go, but no website for customers to see
              what she offered and to book in! Jenny came to us, and we discussed what she needed for her business to
              grow and flurish. <br /><br />Together we settled on a stunningly website that was so simple for all to
              use, where her customers could easily book with their favourite hairdresser. With the backend we built
              Jenny is able to add new services, allocate which of her lovely staff is able to perform them, and how
              long they go for. Along with being able to set staff availability, Jenny is able to give her customers
              real-time accurate booking confidence! She also uses it in store to book in customers who drop in or call
              up.</p><a class="btn mini" href="https://www.jennys.amdesigned.com.au" target="_blank"> <span
