                <p class="description"> Walkers Creek is a camping storage solutions business based on the Sunshine
                  Coast, Australia. They were in need of a website to sell their awesome items, and potentially attract
                  wholesalers. Working with their needs we built a fast, user-friendly, fully-responsive e-commerce
                  website which has seen thousands of site hits and hundreds of sales -- so far!<br /><br />The build
                  included a custom built backend for the owners to login and create, edit and update products, as well
                  as keep track of processed sales and even send their customers postage confirmation emails.We continue
                  to work with the great family behind Walkers Creek to tweak and improve their site and analytics.</p>

                <p class="title">Online Booking - Jenny's Hairdressing</p>
                <p class="description"> The fabulous Jenny has been working her magic for years and finally had decided
                  to build her own hairdressing empire. She had everything ready to go, but no website for customers to
                  see what she offered and to book in! Jenny came to us, and we discussed what she needed for her
                  business to grow and flurish. <br /><br />Together we settled on a stunningly website that was so
                  simple for all to use, where her customers could easily book with their favourite hairdresser. With
                  the backend we built Jenny is able to add new services, allocate which of her lovely staff is able to
                  perform them, and how long they go for. Along with being able to set staff availability, Jenny is able
                  to give her customers real-time accurate booking confidence! She also uses it in store to book in
                  customers who drop in or call up.</p><a class="btn mini" href="https://www.jennys.amdesigned.com.au"
